# The plain universe

The namespace pattern is `http://plain.winery.opentosca.org/TYPE`.
Thus, nodetypes are contained in the namespace `http://plain.winery.opentosca.org/nodetypes`

For each type, there are following variants defined:

- `...WithoutProperties`: Having no property
- `...WithOneKvProperty`: Having one property with `key`
- `...WithTwoKvProperties`: Having two properties with `key1` and `key2`
